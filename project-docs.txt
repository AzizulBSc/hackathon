Excellent choice ✅ — “Customer Support Portal + Smart Chatbot” is a practical, scalable, and AI-integrated project idea that can impress hackathon judges. It combines Laravel (backend), Next.js (frontend), MySQL (DB), and a free LLM API for the chatbot — all feasible within 2–3 weeks.
Below is a complete, professional submission-ready write-up for all the required fields 👇

1. Project Title
SmartSupport – AI-Powered Customer Support & Ticketing Portal

2. Category
Web Application (SaaS / AI Integration / Customer Service)

3. Project Description
SmartSupport is a unified customer service platform that enables businesses to manage customer support tickets efficiently while offering instant assistance through an AI chatbot.
 The platform allows customers to create tickets, view status updates, and chat with a smart assistant trained on business FAQs and previous responses.
 Admins and agents can track, assign, and respond to tickets from a central dashboard.

4. Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle to handle a high volume of customer queries efficiently.
 Traditional customer support systems rely on manual ticket management, resulting in slow responses, repeated questions, and reduced customer satisfaction.

5. Proposed Solution
SmartSupport automates customer service by combining a robust ticket management system with an AI chatbot trained on a company’s FAQ or knowledge base.
Customers get instant answers through the chatbot.


Unresolved queries automatically generate support tickets for agents.


Agents can manage and track all customer interactions from a single Laravel-powered dashboard.


The chatbot uses a free LLM API (e.g., Hugging Face Inference API or Gemini free tier) for context-aware replies.

Would you like me to design a simple system architecture diagram (showing frontend, backend, AI API, and DB connections) for this project next?
 That will make your hackathon submission even more impressive.
